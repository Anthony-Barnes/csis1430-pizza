				<h2>How It All Began</h2>
				<p>Tony Barnes has always been passionate about two things - pizza and people. He made it is mission to bring his two passions together, so in Spring of 2021, he opened Tony's so that he could share delicious pizza with the people of the world. On any given day, Tony himself can be found rushing around attending to the restaurant, but he always has time to stop and visit with customers, so if you see him, be sure to get a fist bump and photo!</p>

				<h2>Putting People First</h2>
				<p>Tony's business philosophy is very much like his pizza-making philosophy. When he first opened Tony's, he knew that, just as a pizza is only as good as its dough, his company's success would depend on the people that work to keep the restaurant operating. By putting time and effort into his employees, just as he would a delicious pizza dough, Tony has made his restaurant just as much a place for them as it is a place for the customers. By making employee happiness a priority, Tony has managed to put together the ultimate pizza-making team that will knock your socks off when you see them in action.</p>
